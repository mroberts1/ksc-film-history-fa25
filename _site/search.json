    "text": "Policies and Procedures\nAttendance\nSince this class meets only weekly, attendance is particularly important. Students are allowed one absence per semester. Two absences will drop your final grade half a letter grade. Three absences will drop your grade a whole letter grade. Any more than three absences, regardless of the reason, and students will have to withdraw from the course (in accordance with Keene State College student handbook). Come and talk to me if you have any problem in attending the class.\nKeene State policy: A student who misses more than 3 weeks in the first 10 weeks of the semester (regardless of the reason, including excused absences and emergencies) must withdraw from the course. The student must follow the regular withdrawal procedure. The complete KSC attendance policy can be viewed at http://www.keene.edu/registrar/policy/policy.cfm#6\n\n\nReadings and assignments\nReadings assigned for each week need to be done prior to the class meeting. Assignments are due at the beginning of the class unless stated differently. Always submit a hard copy of your assignments- no email submissions are accepted unless arranged so.\n\n\n\nDiscussion and participation\nClass discussion (i.e. your participation) is one of the most essential parts of this class. Please come to class fully prepared—both intellectually and physically. Also keep in mind that we always need to work together in order to create a productive and inspiring academic environment by being polite and respectful toward other students’ comments and ideas. In order to ensure your full participation and engagement in class, it is not allowed in this class to use laptop or mobile devices during lecture, discussion, and screenings.\n\n\n\nViewing films\nViewing films in class together with other seminar members is an important part of film education. For this reason, you are expected to pay close attention and take notes during viewing. No eating, checking texts or email, or any other kind of multi-tasking is allowed.\n\n\n\nTechnology problems\nWe tend to rely heavily on computer technology in completing our course work. Keep in mind that technologies can fail, especially when you have a pending due date. Be prepared for possible technical problems and save your files in multiple locations.\n\n\n\nHow to read critical articles\nYou may find some of the articles on the reading list dense or dry. These are theoretical writings that even advanced researchers sometimes find difficult. Do not feel frustrated. Allow enough time for you to read certain sections slowly and repeatedly. Take a break when you are stuck with one particular section of the article. Go back to the article with a fresh perspective. Most importantly, take a note and come up with specific (critical) questions.\n\n\n\nAcademic honesty\nWe understand and agree that we are participating in higher education. We respect this process and will act as mature and responsible individuals in it. To ensure that, all students are expected to hand in original written work. Using other people’s words without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism and any other forms of cheating will result in an F for the assignment and may include further College sanctions. In this class, every student must be aware of and adhere to the college’s policy on academic honesty. Detailed procedures and processes pertaining to the Policy on Academic Honesty can be viewed at http://www.keene.edu/policy/academichonesty.cfm ()"
