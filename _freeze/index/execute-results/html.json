Students are introduced to national cinemas, film movements, genres, major directors/auteurs, and historically significant films. Films are contextualized within both to the history of film itself and the larger historical contexts from which they emerged. They are explored in relation to a wide range of analytical frameworks and concepts. Course assignments provide the opportunity to study historical film movements and pursue research on the works of specific directors.\n\n## Outcomes\n\nBy the end of the course, students will have acquired an in-depth understanding of a wide range of historically significant national cinemas, film movements, major directors, and films. They will also have developed analytical films in understanding films within their larger historical contexts. \n\n## Reading Assignments\n\nThere is no textbook for this course.\n\nReading assignments will be available either as PDFs via Canvas or online articles (follow links for access).\n\n---\n\n##  Writing Assignments\n\n**Film Auteur**\\\n1,500-2000 words / 6-8 pages double-spaced, with bibliography  \nGrading: Letter  \nAt least three films by one of the following filmmakers:\n\n- Michelangelo Antonioni\n- Shirley Clarke\n- Rainer Werner Fassbinder\n- Krzysztof Kieślowski\n- Stanley Kubrick\n- Joseph Losey\n- Louis Malle\n- Albert and David Maysles\n- Andrei Tarkovsky\n- Hiroshi Teshigahara\n- Jacques Tourneur\n- Agnès Varda\n- Charlotte Zwerin\n\n**Film Movement**\\\n1,000 words / 4 pages double-spaced) \nGrading: Letter  \nAn overview of an international film movement (pre-2000 only), involving watching at least three films from the movement in question.\n\n**Film Essay**  \nGrading: Letter   \nPossible topics:\n\n- Film studio (e.g. Cinecittà)\n- Actor/Actress (e.g. Dirk Bogarde, Jeanne Moreau)\n- Cinematographer (e.g. Nestor Almendros)\n\n**Reflection**\\\nGrading: Complete/Incomplete\\  \n250-word reflection on the film screened that week, due by the following class.\\  \nReferences to relevant sources encouraged and will get extra credit.\\ \n10 required; posted on Canvas weekly, from Week 3.  \n\n**Submission Formats** (any permitted)\n\n- Written essay (see specific assignments for details).

Non-compliance with any of these policies will significantly impact your Engagement grade (20%), and in certain cases may result in a failing Engagement grade.\n\n**Classroom Protocol**\n\nYou are encouraged to use a notebook and take notes by hand during class. The use of laptops is permitted, but to take notes only. Laptops must still be closed during screening of films or film clips. \n\nIf I suspect that you are using your laptop for purposes other than to take notes, you will be given one warning. If the the problem persists, your laptop privileges will be withdrawn and you will not be permitted to use the laptop for the remainder of the semester. \n\nThe following may not be used when class is in progress:\n\n- Cellphones\n- Headphones or earbuds\n\nHoods must be worn **down** at all times during class. This is related to the headphones policy---I must be able to see at all times that you are not using headphones. It's also an attention and participation issue, since wearing a hood necessarily limits ambient sound, including lectures and interaction with classmates.\n\n---\n\n**Attendance and Policy on Absences**\n\nAttendance of all scheduled classes is mandatory. \n\nAbsences are classified as Explained or Unexplained. You are permitted **one** Unexplained absence per semester. Up to 2 further absences are permitted, but these must be Explained via email either before or as soon as possible after class. The following reasons are valid for an Explained absence.\n\n- illness \n- bereavement\n- personal emergency\n- attending sports meet\n- job interview\n\nIf you are absent from 3 classes, you are required to arrange a meeting with me to discuss your status in the course and how to proceed.\n\nCollege policy states that a student who is absent more than 3 times during the first 10 weeks of the semester is required to  withdraw from the course, regardless of the reason. The student must follow the regular withdrawal procedure.\n\n---\n\n### Readings and writing assignments\n\nReadings assigned for each week are expected to be completed **prior to** the class meeting. Assignments are due at the beginning of the class unless stated differently. **Please note that email submissions are not accepted.**\n\n---\n\n### Large-Language Models (LLM) and Generative Tools\n\nLLMs such as ChatGPT, Claude, Perplexity, and others have exponentially improved many tasks in academic research, from quickly locating relevant  sources to compiling bibliographies and formatting citations correctly. They are not always accurate, however, and discretion is always advised. \n\nYou are encouraged to make full use of any LLM tools you may be familiar with as research resources, **except** in the case of writing assignments, which must be entirely your own work. If I suspect that you have used a generative tool to write your paper for you, it will receive an automatic grade of F and you will be invited to meet with me during my office hours to present evidence that your work was not produced using a generative tool. If such evidence is not presented, the assignment grade will stand and any further breaches of the LLM protocol may result in failing the course.\n\nThe use of spelling, punctuation, and grammar correction tools such as Grammerly is strongly encouraged, but their content-generating affordances may not be used.\n\n---\n\n### Discussion and participation\n\nClass discussion (i.e. your participation) is one of the most essential parts of this class. Please come to class fully prepared—--both intellectually and physically. Also keep in mind that we always need to work together in order to create a productive and inspiring academic environment by being polite and respectful toward other students’ comments and ideas. In order to ensure your full participation and engagement in class, it is not allowed in this class to use laptop or mobile devices during lecture, discussion, and screenings.\n\n---\n\n### Viewing films\n\nViewing films in class together with other seminar members is an important part of film education. For this reason, you are expected to pay close attention and take notes during viewing. No eating, checking texts or email, or any other kind of multi-tasking is allowed.\n\n---\n\n### Technology problems\n\nWe tend to rely heavily on computer technology in completing our course work. Keep in mind that technologies can fail, especially when you have a pending due date. Be prepared for possible technical problems and save your files in multiple locations.\n\n---\n\n### How to read critical articles\n\nYou may find some of the articles on the reading list dense or dry. These are theoretical writings that even advanced researchers sometimes find difficult. Do not feel frustrated. Allow enough time for you to read certain sections slowly and repeatedly. Take a break when you are stuck with one particular section of the article. Go back to the article with a fresh perspective. Most importantly, take a note and come up with specific (critical) questions.\n\n---\n\n### Academic honesty\n\nWe understand and agree that we are participating in higher education. We respect this process and will act as mature and responsible individuals in it. To ensure that, all students are expected to hand in original written work. Using other people’s words without proper attribution constitutes plagiarism. Plagiarism and any other forms of cheating will result in an F for the assignment and may include further College sanctions. In this class, every student must be aware of and adhere to the college’s policy on academic honesty.
